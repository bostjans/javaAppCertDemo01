What This Application is About</H2>

<H3>Background</H3>

<P>Fly By Night Services is a small but growing travel agency that
provides flight information on a small selection of routes and
carriers. The company's IT department recently had an undergraduate
student in for work experience during the summer vacation. This
undergraduate did some work using the Java programming language and
started to produce a rudimentary database system.

<P>The Information Systems Department Manager now wishes to extend this
work into a usable application. This application should keep scheduled
flight information for a number of airlines and routes, and it should 
provide a
convenient way to search for and book flights that might suit customer's 
requirements.  This is the project that you have been commissioned to 
complete.

<H3>The Current Project Status</H3>

<P>At present, a basic data storage and retrieval system (the
"database") has been implemented and shown to work by the
undergraduate. No network or user level code exists. The database is not 
relational. The data set for
the project exists as a flat ASCII file, and it must be converted as
part of the assignment. Fly By Night Services anticipates that future
projects will use the same database and therefore this conversion
program should be reasonably easy to reuse.

<H3>What you must do</H3>
<P>The following are the "top level" features that must be implemented: 

<UL>
<LI>a graphical user interface for viewing flight information and
booking a flight

<LI>extensions to the database to support a more flexible search
and record locking

<LI>network server functionality for the database system

<LI>communications functionality to connect the user interface with the
database

<LI>data conversion, to prepare the flat text file for use in the database.

</UL>

<H3>How you must do it</H3>

You have been given strict guidelines about the
way the work is to be performed. These guidelines are to 
ensure consistency of marking and to ensure each candidate's workload
is comparable.
</UL>

<P>The work involves a number of design choices that have to be made.
In all such cases, the following principles should be applied.

<DL>
<DT><H4>Clarity and Maintainability.</H4>
<DD>A clear design, such as will be readily understood by junior
programmers, will be preferred to a complex one, even if the complex one
is a little more efficient than the simple choice. However, poor
algorithm design where standard solutions are well known will be
penalized.

<DT><H4>Documentation.</H4>
<DD>The code itself should be as clear as possible, and "obvious"
comments should be avoided. Awkward or complex code should have
descriptive comments, and javadoc style comments must be used for each
element of the public interface of each class. You must create
a full suite of documentation for the classes of the completed project,
including those that form part of this distribution.
This must be achieved using the tool "javadoc" and must be in HTML format.

<P>You should also provide basic user documentation. This should be
sufficient to allow a user who is familiar with the
intent of the project to use the application and conversion program.
If you wish, appropriate parts of the user documentation may be provided
on-line.

<DT><H4>Correctness.</H4>
<DD>The design used must correctly implement the specified requirements.

<DT><H4>Use of Standard Elements and Design Patterns.</H4>
<DD>The design should use standard Java package facilities wherever
possible. Designs should not involve building new code if the effect can
adequately be achieved using facilities in the standard Java packages.
Performance alone is not a justification for ignoring this.

<P><HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="arch"></A>
Overall Architecture</H2>

<P>Architecturally, the application is a traditional client-server
system. There are three key parts: the server-side database with
network server functionality, the client-side graphical user interface,
and a client-side database client part that handles the networking on
behalf of the user interface.

<P>Additionally, the program must be able to work in a non-networked
mode. In this mode, the database and user interface run in the same VM
and no networking is performed. The user must be able to select the
operating mode, although it is acceptable that the program stay in one
mode once it has started up.

<P>You have a choice regarding the network connection protocol. You may
use either serialized objects over a simple socket connection, or you
may use RMI. Your submission will fail automatically if you do not use
one of these approaches.

<P>The remote client code that you write must 
provide all the public methods of the
suncertify.db.Data class.

<P><A HREF="instructions.html#top"><em>Return to top</em></A> 

<P><HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="api_spec"></A>
Supplied Code and Required Enhancements</H2>

<P>The classes and code provided to you include some comments, 
including some in javadoc format. You should refer to these and
consider the source itself for a full understanding of the provided
code.

<P>The following paragraphs outline the packages that are provided
and detail the changes that you must make.

<H3>Deprecated Methods</h3>
<P>In all packages, you should correct any use of deprecated methods. You 
will need to make some decisions about how to achive this. Consult the 
section <a href="#whattodo">What to do if you have a question</a> which 
describes how you should approach this situation.

<H3>Target Platform</H3>
<P>Throughout this exercise, you must use exclusively the Java 2
platform. This means that you should use a distribution of JDK 1.2
with its associated classes and tools. You are not required to develop
your code using any particular implementation of the Java 2 platform,
but the submission that you return <em>must have been tested and shown
to work under Sun Microsystems' reference version of the Java 2
platform</em>.

<p><B><i>Failure to adhere to these directions will result in automatic 
failure</i></B>

<H3>Execution of Submissions</H3>
<p>Your submission must run under the reference version of Sun's JRE
1.2. You may develop using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
but your final product may not have any residual dependency upon that.

<p>When you submit your assignment, you must ensure that it is packaged
in such a way that it is completely clear how the examiner should
run it using the reference JRE 1.2.  Specifically, you should document
clear, simple command lines that allow your programs to be run on any
Java 2 platform, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating
system. These command lines may only take configuration parameters
selected from this list:

<ul>
<li>DNS name of the server
<li>Port number used by the server
<li>Data file name(s)
<li><tt>java.rmi.server.codebase</tt>
<li>security manager policy file
</ul>

<p>You must <em>not</em> require the editing of any files by the examiners.

<p><B><i>Failure to adhere to these directions will result in automatic 
failure</i></B>

<H3>Packaging of Submissions</H3>
<p>All submissions must be packaged in a JAR file.
<P><B>
Database - Package suncertify.db</B></A>

<P>Following is a description of the package that is provided, and of
the extensions you are expected to implement.

<P>Three classes are in this package: Data, DataInfo, and FieldInfo.
With the exception of three methods, noted below, these classes are
complete and functional, and you have the source code for them.  Any
additional classes you create that are related to the database should
be placed in the suncertify.db package.

<H3>Extending suncertify.db.Data</H3>

<P>Part of your assignment will be to enhance the Data class. 
You may do this by modification or subclassing, but you should document the
approach and reason for your choice.

<p>You are required to implement the <tt>criteriaFind(String)</tt>,
<tt>lock(int)</tt> and <tt>unlock(int)</tt> methods:

<P><tt><B>public DataInfo[] criteriaFind(String criteria)</B></tt> 

<P>This method searches the database for entries matching the criteria
supplied. Criteria take the form of a comma separated list of &lt;field
name&gt;=&lt;value to match&gt; specifications.

<P>For example, the following argument string would select all records
describing flights by the SpeedyAir carrier that originate in San
Francisco.  <P><TT>"Carrier='SpeedyAir',Origin='SFO'"</TT>

<P>Note that only exact matches need to be handled in this
<tt>criteriaFind(String)</tt> method.

<P>The method returns an array of DataInfo objects describing all the
records found in the database which match these criteria. In the event
of an invalid field name being provided as part of the criteria the
behavior of this method is the same as if no records matching correctly
specified criteria.

<P><tt><B>public void lock(int record)</B></tt> 
<P><tt><B>public void unlock(int record)</B></tt> 
<P>Record locking must be implemented using the methods
<tt>public void lock(int)</tt> and <tt>public void unlock(int)</tt>.
These methods are required to allow concurrent use of the database when
booking flights from multiple clients. Note that the locking required
is effectively a "write" lock only. If updates occur to a record that
is being displayed on another client, then no change occurs at the
other client. However, if two clients attempt to perform the sequence
lock,read,modify,write,unlock concurrently, then both modification
attempts will be handled correctly.  The aim is to ensure that if two
customers attempt to book a seat on the same flight concurrently, then
the number of available seats is definitely reduced by two, unless
there was only one seat, in which case, one customer will be advised at
booking time that no more seats are available.

<P>The <tt>lock</tt> method should block until the requested lock can be
applied. The integer argument indicates the record to be locked.

<P>The <tt>unlock</tt> method simply removes the lock from the
specified record. If
an attempt is made to unlock a record that has not been locked by this
connection, then no action is be taken.

<H3>Writing the Data Server</H3>

<P>You must create a data server that will accept multiple concurrent
network connections and allow them to interrogate and manipulate the
database. Because multiple concurrent connections may exist, you must
make both your server and the suncertify.db classes threadsafe. You may
implement your threaded server in more than one class if you choose.

<H3>Writing Data Client</H3>

<P>To connect with your server, you should create a client program.
This implementation should include a class that implements the same public 
methods
as the suncertify.db.Data class, although it will need different
constructors to allow it to support the network configuration.

<P><HR>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UI"></A>
Creating the user interface
</H2>

<P>The user interface for this assignment must satisfy the following 
criteria:

<UL>
<LI>Only components from the Java Foundation Classes (Swing components)
should be used.

<LI>The main data output section of the user interface should be created
using a JTable.

<LI>The user interface should connect to the database using either a
local or a network based connection according to user choice.

<LI>The user should be able to select the origin and
destination of flights, and the display should update to show only
flights that satisfy those criteria. The user must be able to describe
"any" for the origin, destination, or both, so as to implement a 
wildcard-like feature.

<LI>The user must be able to book one or more seats on a chosen flight.
If the flight cannot provide those seats, the user must be informed. It
is not necessary to provide for live updates on multiple clients when
new bookings are made at other clients.

</UL>
<P>Your user interface should be designed with the expectation of
future functionality enhancements, and it should establish a control
scheme that will support this with minimal disruption to the users when
this occurs.

<P><HR>
<H2><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="net_protocol"></A>
Network Approaches
</H2>

<P>You may choose between using RMI, or using serialized
objects over TCP socket connections, to implement the database 
network communication. Your choice here will not affect your
grade, but no other approach is acceptable.
In either case, the
program must allow the user to specify the location of the database,
and it must also accept an indication that a local database
is to be used, in which case, the networking must be bypassed
entirely.  No authentication is required for database access.

<P>You may implement such classes as you need in order to support this
network protocol. The classes should be in appropriate packages and
source files, and each method should be documented according to the
general guidelines.

<P><HR>
<H2><P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="data_convert"></A>
The Data Conversion Tool
</H2>

<P>You must create a data conversion tool that reads the flat ASCII data
file and creates a binary file for use by the suncertify.db.Data class.

<P>This should be achieved bearing in mind that Fly By Night Services
expects to make future use of this database and therefore expects to
make use of the conversion tool for other projects in the future.

<P>The conversion tool, along with its user documentation, must be provided
as part of your project submission.

<H3>The Data Set</H3>

<P>The data set provided is given here. You should copy this into an ascii 
file and use it for the project:

Marking
</H2>
<P>This section describes how your submission will be marked, and the
marking criteria which govern allocation of marks for the 
Sun Certified Developer for the Java 2 platform application
submission. The first part describes the marking process, and the
second describes how the marks are allocated.

<P>The first describes
general criteria which are expected to apply to all parts of the
submission. The second part is divided into three sections which describe 
considerations that
are specific to the three main tasks in the requirements: the user
interface, the network connection, and the database search facility.

<B>
<P>How The Assignment is Marked
</B>
<P>The marking is done is two phases. First, the examiner runs the code,
ensuring that it functions correctly through the specified operations.

<P>Provided the essential behavioral requirements of the assignment
have been correctly implemented, the examiner proceeds to investigate
the design and implementation of your assignment.  This process is time
consuming, and it is because this is done carefully and thoroughly that
submissions take time to grade. The grading process is closely
controlled to ensure consistency and fairness, and it is performed
according to criteria detailed in the next section.

<P>In addition to the submission, you will be required to take a
written examination. This exam tests your understanding of your
submission and asks you to justify a number of design choices embodied
in that submission. For any design choice concerning topics not 
specifically
described in the requirements, marks are awarded for a clear and consistent
approach, rather than for any particular solution. <B>Design decisions
should be <I>briefly but clearly</I> described in your comments.</B>

<B><P>
Marking Criteria
</B>
<P>The following marking criteria are given as a guide. The numbers in
parentheses beside each topic indicate the relative proportion of marks
available in that area (note that they do not add up to 100, and hence
are not percentages). Some of these criteria, especially the ones in
"General Considerations," apply in more than one place, and as such
might appear to show a disproportionate score. In some cases, a topic
shows a few notes to elaborate on the meaning of the heading.

<UL>
<LI>General Considerations (Total 72)
<UL>
<LI>ease of use of, and documentation for, finished programs (15)
<LI>consistent and logical approach to problem solving (20)
<LI>adherence to coding standards and readability of code (15)
<LI>clarity and Maintainability of the design and implementation (7)
<LI>consistent and appropriate error handling (10)

<P>You may find that you want to ask for further explanation of some
part of these notes, perhaps to seek permission to solve a problem in a
particular way. These notes deliberately leave some issues unspecified,
and some problems unraised. Your ability to think through these issues,
in the face of realistically imperfect specifications, and come to a
tenable solution is something upon which you are being graded.

<P>You should consider the options available and make a decision about
how to address the problem yourself. This decision making process is
part of the marking scheme, and as such it is crucially important that
you provide documentation of your choice.  Be sure to describe the
options you considered, the perceived benefits and weaknesses of each,
and why you chose the solution you did. You will not be marked on the
choice that you made, but rather on the consistency of your decision
making process and your adherence to other aspects of these notes
during that decision making process.
